I have not seen anything! Whoops!
Who are you?!
I'm not crazy now. You gonna cry?
What did you witness the monster ...!?
Darkness and night. You can see the full moon light, barely big enough to stride was a dark night! Articles hundred soldiers headed to the village ... you and Dorothy was the length of our journey.
Suddenly, a huge full moon, covered with long dark red with a hot eojyeo the blood was more rumble here and there's all over the ring. GM Dorothy nimkkeseo apt to intercept a strange article for me ... Did you have a forward patrol
I received a command to jump straight ahead has confirmed.
At that moment! Ringing of my back screaming. (Aaaaah! Kkeuak!)
Pungent stink of death was bloody.
Too scared to move, can not even bear to turn around
I did not even have the courage to see. Spirit gradually clears
Turn your head to the back of this moment! It was too horrible scene.
Soldiers brutally like a cloth, lying in the shadow of darkness between them a huge sickle walking back view of the monster - Whoops! I'm so horrible!
I'm begging you. I want to be alone! Stop, please.
